Brief project description and purpose.

## Prerequisites

List any prerequisites or dependencies required to run your application. For example:

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Docker (if applicable)

## Getting Started

Download Your Django Capstone Project:

Download your Django Capstone Project to your local machine.

Add a .gitignore File:

In the project's root directory, add a .gitignore file. You can use the provided .gitignore file or create your own based on your project's needs. This file is used to exclude generated files, virtual environments, and other unnecessary files from being tracked by Git.

Initialize a Local Git Repo:

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project's root directory, and run the following command to initialize a local Git repository:

git init
Create or Update requirements.txt:

If your Django project doesn't already have a requirements.txt file, create one. This file should list all the Python packages and dependencies required for your project. You can generate this file automatically by running the following command with your virtual environment activated:

python -m pip freeze -l > requirements.txt
Ensure that the requirements.txt file is included in your repository.

Commit the Project to Local Repo:

Add all the project files to the staging area and commit them to the local repository:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Branch from the master/main Branch:

Create a new branch named 'docs' from the master/main branch:

git checkout -b docs
Add Docstrings and Generate Documentation:

In the 'docs' branch, add docstrings to functions, classes, and modules/scripts in your project to document their purpose and usage. Commit the changes for each documented script one at a time before proceeding with the documentation of the next script.

Generate User-Friendly Documentation with Sphinx:

Ensure you have Sphinx set up for your Django project by adding the necessary code to your conf.py file. The code should include paths to your project and Django settings.

Generate HTML Documentation:

Navigate to the 'docs' folder and remove the old documentation by running:

make clean
Then generate the updated HTML documentation:

make html
The HTML documentation will be available in the _build/html folder.

Commit Documentation Changes:

Commit all changes related to documentation to the 'docs' branch.

Switch to the master/main Branch:

Return to the master/main branch:

git checkout master  # or git checkout main
Create a 'container' Branch:

Create a new branch named 'container' from the master/main branch:

git checkout -b container
Add and Commit a Dockerfile:

Add a working Dockerfile to the 'container' branch. Make sure that your Django app can run on a different computer using Docker.

Switch Back to the master/main Branch:

Return to the master/main branch:

git checkout master  # or git checkout main
Merge 'docs' and 'container' Branches:

Merge the 'docs' and 'container' branches into the master/main branch.

### Setting up a Virtual Environment (optional)

If you prefer to run the project in a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
